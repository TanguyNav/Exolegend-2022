# Exolegend-2022

Here is our post-mortern of the [Exolegend 2022 edition](https://www.exolegend.com/).

## The Contest

The Exolegend is a mobile robotics hackathon organized by the company Exotech. Each team was given a small mobile robot to assemble, with a mechanical structure entirely made with laser-cut wooden parts and toothpicks, an Aruco QR code for localizing it on the field, and a balloon representing the robot life. The objectives were to program it to navigate a maze and collect resources ... and/or to go directly explode the opponents' balloons.

## Our Robots

### The Trunk Weapon

As part of the [DEFROST INRIA team](https://team.inria.fr/defrost/), we had to put deformations somewhere.
We chose to add a tendon-driven soft trunk as weapon. 

Quentin, the floor is your.
